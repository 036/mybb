Forking a private repository
============================

If you fork a private repository on Github, your fork made private by default. Although it's important to note that the forking coder now has the code in his repository, and would be able to do anything they wanted with it - including publishing it as a public project. GitHub will try to protect you, but it can't protect you from yourself

To prevent mistakes I suggest to not fork private repositories from the mybb organization into another account. Instead crate your own branch in the main repository.

I may publish another file describing the recommended workflow in the near future, it will be discussed in The Lair.
